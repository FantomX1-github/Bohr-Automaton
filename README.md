# [GDSE GameJam 2014][1] submission from [anko][2]

*Theme: Explosions, HYPER-challenging, Heights, Automation, Destroy*

If you want to hack and compile, you'll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
Just run `npm install` in the root of this project. That will install all
dependencies and compile the game into `static/`.

If you just want to get the compiled version, I guess I'll have a release ZIP
somewhere maybe later and a version online for someone to play eventually maybe
if I have time!
