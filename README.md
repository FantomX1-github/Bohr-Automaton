I'll put a compiled version up somewhere, sometime.

## Building / hacking

If you want to hack and compile it yourself, you'll need
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  Just run `npm install` in the root of this
project to install all dependencies into `node_modules` (don't worry, there are
no system-level dependencies other than Node) and compile the game into
`static/`. (Running `make all` is equivalent.)

Then run a web server in `static` and point your browser at it.
